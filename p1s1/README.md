Convolution:
The process of using filters/kernals on input, affecting it in a way that produces features as output.

Filters/Kernals:
N X N matrices that are responsible for extracting features from input, like edges, gradients etc. in case of images.

Epoches:
1 Epoche is a  single pass of entire training dataset through the dnn model.

1x1 Convolution:
Process of using a mixing kernal (1x1 Kernal) to combine contextually linked channels.

3x3 Convolution:
Process of using a 3x3 kernal to extract features from inputs.

Feature Maps:
Set of features obtained after performing convolution operations on inputs.

Activation Function:
Functions used on the pixel values, after convolution operation, to fit within a common range making it suitable for next convolution. 

Receptive Field:
Number of pixels, a pixel in the succeeding channels is looking at. If considering neighbouring channel, its local and if considering overall, its global.
